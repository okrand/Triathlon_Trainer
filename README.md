CS795 Project - Detect activities from smartwatch using machine learning

This project aims to detect user activity (running, cycling, neither) using accelerometer and gyroscope data collected from an Apple Watch.
The WatchOS app is written in Swift4. The collected data is later processed using various machine learning techniques, the code for which can be found in the Python files.
